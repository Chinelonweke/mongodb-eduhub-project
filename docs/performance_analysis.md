## Summary: Query Optimization & Execution Stats
| Metric                   | Details                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution Time           | `0 ms` â€“ Query executed very quickly.                                      |
| Total Documents Examined | `2` â€“ MongoDB only scanned 2 documents to find the result.                 |
| Index Used               | `title_1_category_1` â€“ A compound index on `title` and `category` fields.  |
| Query Type               | `Regex search` on title + `Equality match` on category.                    |
| Winning Plan             | `IXSCAN` (Index Scan) â†’ `FETCH` â€“ Efficient use of index to retrieve docs. |
| Index Efficiency         | High â€“ Query used the appropriate compound index and avoided full scan.    |

## Key Takeaways
Efficient Query: The index on title and category was effectively used, avoiding a collection scan.
Low Document Scan Count: Only 2 documents examined means minimal resource usage.
Fast Execution: With 0 ms runtime, this is a highly optimized query.
Regex Support in Index: The query used a case-insensitive regex on the title field, which was still index-supported thanks to the regex's nature and index ordering.


## Summary: Query Optimization on enrollments Collection
| Metric               | Details                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Query Target         | `enrollments` collection                                    |
| Query Condition      | `student_id = "U004"`                                       |
| Execution Plan       | Index Scan (`IXSCAN`) followed by Fetch (`FETCH`)   |
| Index Used           | `student_id_1`                                              |
| Index Bounds         | `["U004", "U004"]` â€“ Narrow scan using equality match       |
| Documents Examined   | Not shown, but very likely minimal due to index use     |
| Query Execution Time | Fast (exact time not specified, but near-instant)           |
| Optimization Flags   | All optimization limits (`maxScansToExplode`, etc.) avoided |



## Key Points
Efficient Index Use: The query used the student_id_1 index to quickly locate matching enrollment documents.
Precise Bounds: The bounds show that it searched exactly for "U004" with no range or full scan.
Minimal Cost: Since student_id is likely a low-cardinality field and the query is exact-match, MongoDB didn't need to scan many documents.

Optimization implementation can be found in the eduhub_mongodb_project.ipynb, under Task 5.
